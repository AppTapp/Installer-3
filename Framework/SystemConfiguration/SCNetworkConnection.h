	@header SCNetworkConnection

		in the system and get connection-status information.

		The functions in the SCNetworkConnection API allow you to
		control and get information about existing services only.
		If you need to create, change, or remove services, you
		should use the SCNetworkConfiguration API instead.

		Note: Currently, only PPP services can be controlled.
