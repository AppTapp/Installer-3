### Version 3.13 (beta in development not done yet)
	
	- Removed UUID tracking, faster source refreshing.
	- Added new permissions check system. If incorrect permissions are set, Installer tells the user how to fix it and then presents an Exit button that quits Installer when tapped. 
	- Temp directory auto generates in ~/Library/Installer. This fixes a possible bug where if Installer.app was not on disk0s2 and was on disk0s1, a single package could fill up the entire root partition due to the Library change.
	- Added BigBoss mirror to Community Sources.
	 -Added native building for jailbroken iPhone and iPod Touch.
	-Added Writer program to create XML.
	-Added arm-apple-darwin8 support and new config script.
	-Implemented script commands into AppTapp Installer Writer: CopyPath, RemovePath, Exec, ExecNoError.
	-Added Saurik's source as default.

### Version 3.12
	
	- Fixed make clean.
	- Redid make zip and make since the permissions and zip -r9 thing doesn't actually work correctly.
	- Moved the private library directory to within Installer.app. This is because when Installer is on a dual boot jailbroken device, it may incorrectly read the other partition's library files otherwise.
	- Tie1r's (pwnstaller) new homepage replaces the defunct one.
	- Builds correctly due to Electimon.
	- Dutch Translations added by Sam Guichelaar.
	- Tweaked installation failed message to be more informative on possible fixes.
